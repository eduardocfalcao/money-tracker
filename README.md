# Money Tracker

This application is to practice some skills as a software engineer and also to practice go language. 
Some of the things I will do in this project:
1. Configure CI and CD pipelines.
2. Set some efficient ways to collect and show metrics and also capture the logs from the application.
3. Create an end to end tests to ensure every single commit quality.
4. Use docker to containerize the application, also use Kubernetes to manage the deploy.
5. Create the CD process to deploy the application to a cloud system (Azure or AWS)
